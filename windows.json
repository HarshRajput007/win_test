    "name":"Windows 10 October 2018 Update review: Little refinements make a big difference!",
    "date":"Today",
    "description":"The latest Windows 10 feature update brings with it lots of refinements and a few new features. So is it any good? Check out our in-depth review for answers.\n\nIt's been almost seven months since the last Windows 10 feature update was released to the public, and we're due for another big one. After some early issues, Microsoft today will begin rolling out the Windows 10 October Update to the world again, bringing with it new features, enhancements, and more to millions of Windows 10 PCs.\n\nMicrosoft has gotten very good at making sure these big new updates don't change much on the surface, ensuring users won't be freaked out by huge new changes once the update is installed. The changes will only become apparent once you start digging a little bit. On that note, we did some digging to find the most significant new changes and features available in the October 2018 Update.\n\nTo be clear, the big issue that caused Microsoft to initially pull the update has been fixed, meaning when the update reaches you, you won't need to worry about losing your files when the update eventually installs itself.\n\n In depth video tutorial\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BkTxFknDKzQ",

    "name":"Do you really need a gaming headset?",
    "date":"Today",
    "description":"Best answer: Having a good headset on hand offers you significant advantages both inside and outside of games that you can't afford to pass up. You can play without one, but you can't take the experience to the next level, either.\n\nWhat advantages do headsets bring?\n\nHeadsets allow you to do two key things that speakers don't: filter sound directly into your ears and give you a microphone to use for in-game communication. The former is fantastic if you're playing late at night and don't want to disturb the rest of your household, and the latter drastically improves your communication capabilities while in-game.\n\nIn addition, if you want top-of-the-line sound quality during gaming experiences, headsets are much more budget-friendly than good speaker setups, which often cost $200 and above. Due to this, choosing a headset over speakers is a smart decision if you're a dedicated gamer.\n\nIf you already own a jack-of-all-trades headset, you might be wondering why you might need one designed specifically for gaming. The three main things that set gaming headsets apart from regular ones are the comfort, sound quality, and microphone quality.\n\nMost normal headsets are designed to be used for brief periods of time, like for business meetings or phone calls, and gaming headsets are designed with long, intense gaming sessions in mind. In a situation like that, you want your headset to be comfortable over time, for it to have excellent sound quality, and for your microphone to be very sensitive to your voice. Sure, a normal headset will work, but you'll have a much more enjoyable experience using a headset that's built for playing games.\n\nWhich gaming headset should you choose?\n\nThe gaming headset market is as wide as an ocean, so the best headset for you is mostly dependent on which platform you use and what your budget is. However, we think the best all-around gaming headset is the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas. Offering a sleek look, high sound quality, a comfortable wearer experience, and a great mid-range price of $100, the Turtle Beach Elite Atlas will get the job done well regardless of which platform or system you game on.\n\nIf the Elite Atlas is a little on the pricey side for you, then we recommend the HyperX CloudX headset. Though it released two years ago, the CloudX still holds up well by today's standards, and you can grab a pair for $20 less than the Elite Atlas.",

    "name":"Microsoft starts testing ads in the Windows 10 Mail app (Update)",
    "date":"Today",
    "description":"It looks like the rollout of ads in Mail was an accident and they're now being turned off. Microsoft communications lead Frank Shaw stated on Twitter: “This was an experimental feature that was never intended to be tested broadly and it is being turned off.” The original story follows.\n\nBanner ads may soon be on the way to the stock Mail app in Windows 10. As first reported by Aggiornamenti Lumia, Microsoft is now testing ads in the Mail app with Windows Insiders on the Fast ring, and you'll need an Office 365 subscription to get rid of them.\n\nStarting with Mail version 11605.11029.20059.0, the app will show banner ads in the 'Other' section when the Focused Inbox is enabled. The only way to go ad-free is to subscribe to Office 365, which is explained with a new pop-up within the app. However, complicating matters is that you'll see the ads no matter what email provider you're using in the app. For example, you'll see ads even if you're signed in with a Gmail account.\n\nThis is sure to cause some consternation among users, as other ads and recommendations peppered throughout Windows 10. Most recently, Microsoft pulled back on a test that promoted Microsoft Edge when Windows 10 users attempted to install a third-party browser, responding to a torrent of backlash the test received. It's possible that ads in Mail could likewise remain a test, never seeing the light of day beyond the Insider program. ",

    "name":"Microsoft patents dual screen device which can display 3D representations!",
    "date":"Today",
    "description":"There’s yet another interesting patent application by Microsoft which appears to detail a foldable dual-screen mobile device with the focus entirely on emulation of 3D representations of the virtual object.\n\nTitled “MANIPULATING VIRTUAL OBJECTS ON HINGED MULTI-SCREEN DEVICE”, the patent was published by USPTO earlier this week and it details a Microsoft’s dual-screen device with the ability to render 3D representations of virtual objects.\n\n“Users interact with multi-screen mobile devices throughout a variety of positions, including holding the device vertically, holding the device with a primary screen facing toward the user, holding the screen with a second screen facing toward the user, and other positions and orientations. However, users may encounter difficulties manipulating virtual three-dimensional objects on the two-dimensional screens. Conventional methods employ an external input device, such as a mouse, to manipulate virtual three-dimensional objects on two-dimensional display screens, which may be cumbersome and inconvenient for users,” Microsoft writes in the background section of the patent.\n\nMicrosoft has explained the patented method below:\n\n“To address the above issues, a mobile computing device is provided. The mobile computing device comprises a housing having a first part and a second part coupled by a hinge, the first part including a first display and a second part including a second display, a sensor mounted in the housing and configured to detect a hinge angle between the first and second parts of the housing, and a processor mounted in the housing. The processor is configured render and cause to be displayed on a display a two-dimensional view of a virtual object on the first display, and a three-dimensional view of the virtual object on the second display. The three-dimensional view of the virtual object is rendered based on the detected hinge angle between the first and second parts of the housing”.",
